# MWD-ContextualStoryApp
For the end assignment of my Minor Web Development I will be making a webapp with a story, that changes depending on the user.
It will be used mainly for testing the effect of these kind of stories on user. Marolijn Ruyg is the procject owner, who will use it in her research.

The app will allow (at first only) the writer/admin to add stories with variables that change depending on the user, their location, current weather ect.
Admin will also be able to edit the userprofiles and set wich user can see the stories and in wich order they will be read.

Readers will only be able to create an account, add data and read the stories.

There might be a possiblity in the future to allow other user to make and publish stories through this app, but this will need to be decided by the project owner.
